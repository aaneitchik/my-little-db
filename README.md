# Videolib

This is an app that was created as a task from the university. It has some database management possibilities, like :

- inserting, updating and deleting rows in tables
- running some defined queries
- enabling/disabling existing triggers

### Tech
Just like many apps created during studies at the university, this one is also a playground to try and experiment with different libraries and technologies, among them:
* [react]
* [react-stamp]
* [redux]
* [node.js]
* [express]
* [webpack]

### Running the app
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.

The app uses an Oracle database, the code to create it can be found in *db/db.sql*

Install the dependencies and devDependencies, go to root folder, open your terminal and run these commands:

First Tab:
```sh
$ node server\index.js
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ npm start
```
